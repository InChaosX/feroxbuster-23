# dirhuntr

`dirhuntr` is a lightweight and customizable **Python tool** for directory and file enumeration.  
It uses asynchronous requests (`aiohttp` + `asyncio`) for fast and efficient discovery of hidden or unlinked web resources.  
The goal is to provide a simple starting point similar to tools like `feroxbuster` or `gobuster`, tailored for testing your own environments.  

> ⚠️ **Legal Disclaimer**  
> Do **not** use this tool on systems you do not own or do not have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning may be illegal and could lead to serious consequences.  
> Use responsibly in staging, testing, or lab environments only.
